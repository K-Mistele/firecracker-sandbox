# Firecracker sandbox ðŸ§¨
Have fun playing with firecrackers! This repository contains everything needed to create and run "sandboxes" (firecracker VMs)
based off of Docker images. It was originally created as a proof-of-concept for sandboxing arbitrary code execution; whether run by humans or AI agents. The design reflects this in some cases. 

## Getting Started

### Creating a linux kernel image
You will need a compiled linux kernel image to build your firecracker VMs. This project includes a "batteries included" kernel builder that builds a kernel in docker; provided by [fadams/firecracker-in-docker](https://github.com/fadams/firecracker-in-docker).

You can change the kernel image you want to build by replacing `kernel-builder/.config` with one of the options from `kernel-builder/resources`; make sure to name the file `kernel-builder/.config`. 

```shell 
cd kernel-builder 

# create the docker image that will be used to compule the kernel
docker build -t firecracker-kernel-builder . --load # use --load if you're on docker buildx

# once you have set the config you want to kernel-builder/config; the default is like 5.15 
./kernel-builder
```

This will compile the kernel and save it to `launcher/kernel/vmlinux`. Don't commit this file.

### Creating a filesystem for your microvms using docker.

You can create a microVM filesystem from a docker image on a remote repository, for example using python 3.12:
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/image-builder
image-builder python:3.12-slim
```

Or, you can use a docker image that you've already compiled and loaded into your docker build cache:
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/image-builder
docker build -t some-docker-image -f Dockerfile-something .
docker save some-docker-image some-docker-image.tar
image-builder some-docker-image.tar
```

This will create a directory named something like `firecracker-<image_name>` where `<image_name>` is a shortened form of the container tag you specified. 

For example, `python:3.12-slim` will result in a directory named `firecracker-python`

At this point, you have the two essential components for creating a firecracker virtual machine.
